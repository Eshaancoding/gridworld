## SARSA: Windy Gridworld

I am going to attempt to use on-policy Expected Sarsa and on-policy Sarsa to solve the task Windy Gridworld, a task detailed in page 130 from the Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton & Barto. The Sarsa algorithm is also detailed in that page. 

The other algorithm that I am going to compare is the Expected Sarsa algorithm, detailed in page 133 (same book). 

Both policies are stochastic, but overtime both become of the policies will become deterministic. Therefore, the two policies should be e-greedy policies. This will ensure exploration. e-greedy policies are described in page 100.
