## SARSA Windy Gridworld

I am going to attempt to use Expected Sarsa and Sarsa to solve the task Windy Gridworld, a task detailed in page 130 from the Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton & Barto. The Sarsa algorithm is also detailed there. 

The Expected Sarsa algorithm is in page 133. This means that I will need to turn the policy stochastic instead of deterministic.
